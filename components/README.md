| **RASPBERRY PI** | The Raspberry Pi is very small and light, so it is easy to carry and fit in different places. It uses little electricity, which helps save power. It is easy to use, even for beginners, and there are many tutorials and a big online community that can help. However, it is not very strong and has limited memory, so it cannot run very large programs or deep learning models. If it works too much, it can get hot, and it is slower than a full computer when handling heavy tasks. | ![image-removebg-preview (5)](https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcSNjdFTogzNWNns1mfd1fhjfLgDHLenUuARvw&s) |
| **ARDUINO UNO** | Open-sourcThe Arduino Uno is a small and simple board that allows people to make interactive electronic projects. It is easy to use for beginners, and there are many tutorials and a large community to help. It can control lights, motors, and sensors, making it good for learning electronics and building small devices. However, it has limited memory and processing power, so it cannot handle very complex tasks or run large programs. It also does not have built-in wireless features, and it is slower compared to a full computer for advanced projects. | ![image-removebg-preview (5)](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/38/Arduino_Uno_-_R3.jpg)|
| **ULTRASONIC SENSOR** | An ultrasonic sensor is an electronic device that uses sound waves to measure distance. It sends out ultrasonic waves through the air, and when these waves hit an object, they bounce back. The sensor receives the reflected sound and converts it into an electrical signal, which tells how far the object is. Ultrasonic sensors are easy to use and can measure distances without touching the object. However, they can be affected by soft or uneven surfaces, and they have a limited range. They also may not work well in very noisy environments or in strong wind.  | ![image-removebg-preview (6)](https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcQUyegBfSW_W0U-_pU9VsVvKSC8r9o_HopU3g&s) |
|**raspberry pi camera module 3** | The Raspberry Pi Camera Module 3 is a small camera that connects to the Raspberry Pi to capture images and videos. It can take clear and detailed pictures, which can be used for projects like detecting objects, following lanes, or planning paths for robots. It is easy to use and works well with Raspberry Pi software. However, it needs good lighting to take clear images, and it may not perform well in very dark or very bright conditions. It also depends on the Raspberry Pi’s processing power, so complex image tasks can be slow. | ![image-removebg-preview (7)](https://thepihut.com/cdn/shop/products/raspberry-pi-camera-module-3-raspberry-pi-sc0872-40039005159619_2048x.jpg?v=1673207975) |
| **WRO future engineers set** | The WRO Future Engineers Set is a kit that provides all the physical parts needed to build a small self-driving car, called the elf car. It includes pieces like motors, wheels, sensors, and other components that help students learn how to assemble and control a robot. It is very useful for learning engineering, electronics, and programming in a practical way. However, it has limited parts and features, so very complex projects may not be possible. Some assembly and programming can be challenging for beginners, and the car’s performance depends on how carefully it is built and programmed. | ![71GffrS4wsL _AC_SX679_-removebg-preview](https://funduinoshop.com/media/image/08/f8/74/YFROBOT-chassis-kit-mit-lenkachse-1_200x200@2x.jpg)|
| **tcs 43725** | The TCS color sensor, made by Texas Instruments, is used to detect and measure colors. It can read different colors for projects like sorting objects or following colored lines. It is easy to use, but it may not work well in very dark or very bright light, and it needs careful placement to get accurate readings.  | ![71GffrS4wsL _AC_SX679_-removebg-preview](https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/6169sOb8-VL._AC_UF1000,1000_QL80_.jpg)|
| **servo motor** | A servo motor is a small motor that can move to a specific angle with precision. It is often used in robots, cars, and other devices to control parts like wheels, arms, or cameras. It is easy to control with a microcontroller and provides accurate movement. However, it has limited rotation range, can be weak for heavy loads, and may get hot if used for long periods.  | ![71GffrS4wsL _AC_SX679_-removebg-preview](https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/41r5LS1lYHL._AC_UF350,350_QL80_.jpg )|
| **dc motor** | A DC motor is an electric motor that uses direct current to produce movement or mechanical force. It is commonly used in robots, cars, fans, and other devices to make things spin or move. It is simple to use and can run at different speeds with the right control. However, it does not provide very precise control of position, can wear out over time, and may need extra parts like gears to increase strength or control.  | ![71GffrS4wsL _AC_SX679_-removebg-preview](https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/31j41t1Y27L._AC_UF1000,1000_QL80_.jpg)|
| **raspbot** | Raspbot is a smart car kit that can be used to learn about AI and robotics. It comes with wheels, motors, sensors, and a controller, allowing students to build and program their own small car. It is useful for learning programming, electronics, and AI in a hands-on way. However, it has limited features, so very advanced projects may not be possible. Its performance depends on careful assembly and proper programming, and some tasks can be challenging for beginners. | ![71GffrS4wsL _AC_SX679_-removebg-preview](http://www.yahboom.net/Public/images/newsimg/600f914608baa.jpg)|
